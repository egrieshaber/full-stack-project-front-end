METAL HEDZ

Description.

  This app is a fun idea where the user is basically able to create new "fantasy" bands and also be able to add members from an existing database or create their own.

Process.

  I began this project by reviewing the requirements and talking through some basic ideas/concepts with my classamtes and instructors.  Then, I began to build a Rails API, after which I constructed a front end using JavaScript.  I've also used HTML to layout the style of the page.  I am currently only achieving the minimal viable product and have not successfully been able to meet my personal goals for this project.  I plan to neaten the look of the front end using CSS and also need to join a second table of band members in order to be added to the bands which the user is creating.
